I got accepted for the project, Integration of Cantor into LabPlot in this year's google summer of code (GSOC) under mentor Alexander Semke with KDE Organization. Looking forward to...

First phase to GSOC 2015 has ended, that is community bonding period. I have tried my best to interact with my mentor and community members, but I was mostly occupied with my university examination during most of the time.

Looking forward to the coding period I have started working on integration of Cantor's UI into LabPlot. I will push all my commits to branch integrate-cantor[[1]](https://projects.kde.org/projects/kdereview/labplot/repository/show?rev=integrate-cantor) of LabPlot.

Looking forward to learn, code and develop this summer !
