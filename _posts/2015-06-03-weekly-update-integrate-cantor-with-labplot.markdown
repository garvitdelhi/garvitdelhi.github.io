This is a weekly update on my GSOC 2015 Project Integrate Cantor with LabPlot. As I mentioned in my last post that I will be starting my work with integration of UI of Cantor inside LabPlot. I would like to inform my fellow developers that I have integrated the UI successfully. I present the screenshots hereafter.

For now I have created Maxima Session and now I work on different backends, implementing property section, different actions needed for the management of cantor's session in the upcoming week. I hope to integrate cantor's worksheet completely by midterm evaluation.
