Hi!, I am Garvit Khatri, Sofware Development Engineer at [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com). I have been working for Zomato since July 2016. I was part of Google Summer of Code 2016 as a Mentor for [LabPLot](https://labplot.kde.org/). You can find details about the project I mentored [here](https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2016/StatusReports/anumittal). I also participated as a student in Google Summer of Code Student in 2015 for the [project of integrating LabPlot with Cantor](https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2015/Ideas#Project:_Integrate_Cantor_into_LabPlot). Before that, I was a student developer at [Season of KDE](https://season.kde.org), an outreach program hosted by the KDE community. I graduated from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/) (formerly known as Delhi College of Engineering) in May 2016 with a degree in Engineering Physics.

I am an open source enthusiast and fell in love with the idea of open source from the moment I got to know about it. I have been contributing to various projects like [Typo3](https://typo3.org/), [KDE Knetwalk](https://www.kde.org/applications/games/knetwalk/), [KDE KReversi](https://www.kde.org/applications/games/kreversi/), [KDE LabPlot](https://labplot.kde.org/) and [CPython](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html#locale). I have also contributed to many small projects started by open source enthusiasts at my university.

I also attend regional, national and international meetups to meet different people and explore the world of open source. I have also spoken at various national and international conferences. You can find me online with my handle @garvitdelhi, or drop an email to me at [garvitdelhi@gmail.com](mailto:garvitdelhi@gmail.com)
